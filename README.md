Some python scripts for EEG signals analysis associated with my MSc thesis.
- [Other related repository!](https://github.com/K-Hun/multimedia-learning-hci)
- Data have been collected via [eWave](https://sciencebeam.com/ewave-eeg-erp-81624/).

# Features
  - EEG frequency band(delta, theta, alpha and beta) extraction using DWT
  - Extracting EEG features at any time Intervals of the task:
    * ERD|ERS
    * Sample Entropy
    * Spectral Entropy
    * Approximate Entropy

# Notes
[pyeeg](https://github.com/forrestbao/pyeeg) has been used for calculating some of the entropies mentioned in the feature section.
